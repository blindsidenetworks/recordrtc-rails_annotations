This is the open-source version of the app!



Ruby 2.4.0 + Rails 5.1.1 (+ FFMPEG for recording thumbnails).  
Use `bundle install` to install all required dependencies.  
Run `cp sample.env .env` and change the database values in the file to suit your environment.  
Run `rails secret` and place your generated secret keys (a different one for each Rails environment) in `.env`.  
Run `rails railties:install:migrations`, `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed`.  
Start app with `rails s`!

### KNOWN BUGS

* App doesn't work in a iFrame because X-Frame-Options only allows iFrames of same domain origin (maybe after_action :disable_xframe_header?)
* Gaffe error pages might not work with people who haven't POSTed an LTI launch as it does not skip the authentication token verification

### TO-DO

* Add user (re)authentication where needed
* Authenticate CSRF token before accessing API
* Rename and organize controllers and routes
* Consider using OAuth2 gem instead of simple_oauth; check to see what is required to move over
* Examine security of certain routes opened up by js-routes
* OPTIONAL: Add video thumbnails to home page
* OPTIONAL: Integrate Shrine's URL storage for cache
* TBD: Add support for audio recording (if determined to be needed)

### NOTES

* As of yet, no known way to attach blob to file input in form, so a mock-form sent as XHR FormData is necessary in lieu of form_for
* Cannot separate concerns for React files
* DataTables is causing column-resizing troubles. For now, the too-large "Actions" column is not such a big deal
* Gaffe integration is all default, can customize more later for regular path errors and API errors
* Session variables are a bit iffy right now; who knows what will happen when the same person has two open instances of the tool! Shouldn't be too much of a problem as the only things I am storing in the session are unchanging.
* Right now, uses user_id LTI parameter to associate with accounts, but should be using person_sourcedid; however, for some reason, person_sourcedid does not exist for every LMS user
* API is using session to get account_id and present only videos belonging to that user, which violates the statelessness of it; consider switching to JWT instead of sessions
